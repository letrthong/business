Difference Between Business Administration vs. Business Management

https://smallbusiness.chron.com/difference-between-business-administration-business-management-31390.html

The role of business administrators is primarily centered on carrying out the tasks and duties defined by management. Business administrators direct the flow of work that allows your company to operate effectively, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Managers of administrative offices typically oversee billing and accounting departments, human resources, contract development and oversight, and records management. They may direct the flow of communications within and outside the company. Secretarial workers and administrative assistants provide support services for management as well.
